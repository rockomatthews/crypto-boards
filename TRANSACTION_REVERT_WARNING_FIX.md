# Transaction Revert Warning Fix

The 'transaction will revert' warning was coming from your Solana wallet and was a LEGITIMATE warning that should NOT be ignored.

## The Problem
- Users didn't have enough SOL for entry fee + gas fees
- No balance validation before transactions
- Wallet warned about inevitable transaction failure

## The Fix
We've added:
- Real-time SOL balance display
- Pre-transaction validation
- Button disabled if insufficient funds  
- Clear error messages with exact amounts needed

## Result
No more revert warnings! Users now see their balance and get prevented from making payments they can't complete.
