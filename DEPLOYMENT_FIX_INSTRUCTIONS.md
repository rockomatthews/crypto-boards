# üö® URGENT: Deployment Fix Instructions

## Problem
Your production site `www.solboardgames.com` is **NOT getting the latest code updates** that fix:
- ‚úÖ Direct SOL payments (bypasses broken escrow APIs)
- ‚úÖ Profile API 500 errors (fixed dead code bug)
- ‚úÖ Stats not working (fixed database query issues)

## Code Status
- ‚úÖ **Fixed locally** - builds successfully
- ‚úÖ **Pushed to GitHub** - all changes committed
- ‚ùå **NOT deployed** - production site still has old broken code

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Vercel Connection (Recommended)
1. Go to **vercel.com** dashboard
2. Find your `www.solboardgames.com` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
4. Ensure it's connected to: `https://github.com/rockomatthews/crypto-boards.git`
5. Click **"Redeploy"** or trigger manual deployment

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy this fixed codebase
vercel --prod

# This will create a new deployment with working fixes
```

### Option 3: Emergency Fix API Only
If you can't redeploy immediately, I can create a simple fix for just the profile API:

```bash
# Quick patch deployment
git checkout -b emergency-fix
# Make minimal profile API fix
git push origin emergency-fix
# Deploy from emergency branch
```

## What The Fixes Do

### 1. Direct SOL Transfer ‚úÖ
```javascript
// NEW: Direct blockchain transaction in game completion
const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(transaction, [platformKeypair]);
// Result: Winners get SOL immediately when game ends
```

### 2. Profile API Fix ‚úÖ
```javascript
// FIXED: Removed dead code that caused 500 errors
// Added proper error handling and fallbacks
// Result: Stats and profile pages work correctly
```

## Testing After Deployment
Once deployed, test:
```bash
# Should return user data instead of 500 error
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/profile?walletAddress=test123"

# Should return deployment info
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/test-deployment"
```

## Next Steps
1. **Fix the deployment connection** (primary issue)
2. **Test the profile API** immediately
3. **Test a full game** to verify SOL payments work
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues**
