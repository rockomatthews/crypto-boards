# Cosmic Background Image

To complete the homepage design, save the second cosmic background image you provided as:

```
public/images/cosmic-background.jpg
```

## Instructions:

1. Save the second image (the cosmic background with the planet and terrain) as `cosmic-background.jpg` in this folder
2. The image should be high resolution (recommended: at least 1920x1080)
3. If you want to use a different filename, update the reference in `src/app/page.tsx` line 11

## Current Design Features:

✅ **Bangers Font** - Imported from Google Fonts
✅ **"SOL BOARD GAMES"** - Main title with cosmic glow effects  
✅ **"CLASSIC BOARD GAMES FOR GAMBLING CRYPTO"** - Subtitle with floating animation
✅ **Cosmic Gradients** - Animated background with starfield
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
✅ **Text Animations** - Glowing and floating effects

## Fallback:
If no background image is provided, the design will use animated cosmic gradients as a fallback.
