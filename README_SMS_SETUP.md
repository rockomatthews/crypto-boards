### Step 2: Choose Your SMS Provider

#### For Twilio Setup:
1. Create account at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token from console
3. Purchase a phone number
4. Add to `.env`:

```env
SMS_PROVIDER=twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

#### For TextGrid Setup:
1. Create account at [textgrid.com](https://textgrid.com)
